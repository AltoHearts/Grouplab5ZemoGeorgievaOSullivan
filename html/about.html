<h1> About our Company </h1>

<p>In Summer of 1984 founders Aven Zemo, Veliana Georgieva, Maria Oâ€™Sullivan decided to do a Year Up, or a Year of travel Up and around the world, and discovered that tourism was actually environmentally damaging to the popular locations and historical sites. The masses of people cause erosion as they walk through the sites. Litter and vandalism is almost inevitable. The founders decided to create a travel agency that protected the welfare and preserved the beauty of the world, while allowing people of all income ranges the freedom to travel. In 1985, VMA opened its doors as a small travel agency office in Seattle WA.
Today, VMA has changed gears and is now a lucrative corporate travel agency. Allowing people to plan flights and travel with convenience and low prices.
